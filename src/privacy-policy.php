      <strong>Why am I reading this?</strong>
      <p>
        The SCSK EU is sensitive to privacy issues and we are strongly committed to protecting the privacy of those people whose information we handle.
        To demonstrate our firm commitment to your privacy, we created this Privacy Policy to tell you what information we hold about you and how we use it and also to explain the rights that you have
        over your information.
      </p>
      <strong>Who are the SCSK EU?</strong>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy covers the use of your information by the SCSK EU. Details of all of the entities in the SCSK EU are set out at the end of this Privacy Policy.
        The SCSK EU entity that will be the Controller of your information will be the entity with which you have a relationship. As such, any references in this Privacy Policy to “we”, “our”, “us” etc. will
        be interpreted as a reference to the relevant Controller entity.
        If you have any questions about which SCSK EU entity is the Controller of your information, you can contact us using the details set out at the end of this Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <strong>What information do you hold about me and how do you use it?</strong>
      <p>
        The information we hold on you and how we use it will vary depending on the nature of your relationship with us.
      </p>
      <strong>I work for one of your customers</strong>
      <p>
        We do not have any individual customers but we will hold information about you if you are a contact at one of our corporate customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>What information do you hold on me?</span>
        <br>
        If you are one of our customer contacts, the information we hold on you will be limited to: your first name, surname, contact details; the name of your employer (our customer); and details of our
        interactions and correspondence with you (specifically our emails with you and the notes we make in relation to our telephone conversations, meetings and other interaction with you). This
        information will have been provided to us either by you or by someone else at the customer company (such as your manager or another colleague)in the course of our business dealings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>What do you do with my information?</span>
        <br>
        We only use your information for the purpose of legitimate interests being pursued by us and by our customer in relation to the services or products that we provide. For example, we will use
        your information: to contact you to discuss our services and products (and any changes to them); to respond to any questions or concerns you have raised; to deal with administrative matters
        such as invoicing and renewal; and to otherwise carry out our obligations arising under our contract with the customer and to enforce the same. If another entity acquires us or our assets, your
        information may be disclosed to that entity as part of the due diligence process and, if the acquisition goes ahead, your information will be transferred to that entity.
        <br>
        We may also contact you via email from time to time with information we think may be of interest to your company about our products and services. If you do not want to be contacted in this
        way, you can tell us by contacting us using the details set out at the end of the Privacy Policy.
        <br>
        We will not use your information for any other purposes unless we are required to do so by law, in connection with any legal proceedings, or in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal
        rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Do you share my information?</span>
        <br>
        Your information will be shared internally amongst our employees but only as required in order to carry out their duties in line with the purposes set out above.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>Where is my information stored?</span>
        <br>
        Your personal data will be stored locally in the UK / in our offices by us but may also be stored and backed up on servers located outside of the European Economic Area – specifically, in Japan
        and in the United States. We ensure that your data is protected in these countries by requiring the recipients of your data to enter in standard contractual clauses which have been approved by
        the European Commission.
